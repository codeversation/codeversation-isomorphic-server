## Problem Statement

Currently, there is no way to collaborate in browser on coding projects with immediate feedback. Since there are already options for receiving feedback on code, and ways to edit code in the browser, we will bring these two concepts together to create a collaborative coding environment. This project will set itself apart by having immediate evaluation and a snippet history via git version control in a browser based setting.

## Project Objectives

- Make a messaging/live coding forum with authenticated users (a la Stack Overflow).
- This forum will have the following features:
    - Live snippet evaluation
    - Git managed diffs and history of snippets
    - Preconfigured environments
    - Instant post updates
    - Multiple programming languages supported

## Stakeholders

***Users:*** Anybody that programs or wants to program while utilizing online, collaborative programming.  
***Developers:*** Alex Aralis, Patricia Chun, Jeremy Lehman, Zach Perry  
***Development Managers:*** Our 307 TAs  
***Project Managers:***
